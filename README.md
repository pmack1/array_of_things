#H1  Using Plenario to Make Maps

#H2 Potholes Filled in Chicago
This map uses the Plenario API as the primary data source and supplements this information with data from the Census API

The Javascript API Leaflet is used to visualize the map. The map is based on a tutorial from leafleft found here: [Leaflet Tutorial](http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/)

Colors for the map were selected with the help of [Color Brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=Blues&n=6)
